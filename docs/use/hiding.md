# Hide cell contents

You can use Jupyter Notebook **cell tags** to control some of the behavior of
the rendered notebook. This uses the [**`sphinx-togglebutton`**](https://sphinx-togglebutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
package to add a little button that toggles the visibility of content.[^download]

[^download]: This notebook can be downloaded as
            **{nb-download}`hiding.ipynb`** and {download}`hiding.md`

(use/hiding/code)=

## Hide code cells

You can use **cell tags** to control the content hidden with code cells.
Add the following tags to a cell's metadata to control
what to hide in code cells:

* **`hide-input`** tag to hide the cell inputs
* **`hide-output`** to hide the cell outputs
* **`hide-cell`** to hide the entire cell

For example, we'll show cells with each below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
data = np.random.rand(2, 100) * 100
```

Here is a cell with a `hide-input` tag. Click the "toggle" button to the
right to show it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

# This cell has a hide-input tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points =ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```

Here's a cell with a `hide-output` tag:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]

# This cell has a hide-output tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points =ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```

And the following cell has a `hide-cell` tag:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# This cell has a hide-cell tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points =ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```

(use/hiding/markdown)=

## Hide markdown cells

You cannot hide an entire markdown cell, but you can hide sections of markdown **content** by using roles and directives.

For information on how to hide / toggle markdown content in Sphinx, see either [the `sphinx-togglebutton` documentation](https://sphinx-togglebutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the [`sphinx-design` dropdowns documentation](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dropdowns.html).

(use/removing)=

## Remove parts of cells

Sometimes, you want to entirely remove parts of a cell so that it doesn't make it
into the output at all. To do this, you can use the same tag pattern described above,
but with the word `remove_` instead of `hide_`. Use the following tags:

* **`remove-input`** tag to remove the cell inputs
* **`remove-output`** to remove the cell outputs
* **`remove-cell`** to remove the entire cell

Here is a cell with a `remove-input` tag. The inputs will not make it into
the page at all.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

# This cell has a remove-input tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points =ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```

Here's a cell with a `remove-output` tag:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-output]

# This cell has a remove-output tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points = ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```

And the following cell has a `remove-cell` tag (there should be nothing
below, since the cell will be gone).

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

# This cell has a remove-cell tag
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
points = ax.scatter(*data, c=data[0], s=data[0])
```
